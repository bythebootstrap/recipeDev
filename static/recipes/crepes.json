    "ingredients": [
        "1.5 cups flour",
        "1 tablespoon sugar",
        "1/2 tsp baking powder",
        "1/2 tablespoon salt or more to taste",
        "2 cups milk",
        "2 eggs",
        "1 tsp vanilla",
        "2 tablespoons melted butter"
    ],
    "directions": "Blend (for best results: let sit overnight in the fridge, still in the blender. Take it out in the morning and blend just a little more before using), then pour a small amount in a well buttered pan, tilting it to spread the batter thinly across the entire pan. These don't need long to cook, just look for the batter to solidify (not bubble like pancakes). Use a rubber spatula to pull any stuck edges from the pan before sliding onto a plate. Then, you can fill with cinnamon sugar, jam and cream cheese, or just about anything else you want (try some savory options too, like spinach & cheese or smoked salmon. Just omit the vanilla from the crepe batter) & roll it up. If you are having sweet crepes, you can top with powdered sugar for plate appeal. Tip: if you aren't going to be serving these as they are ready, keep your oven on “warm” and store the crepes in there until you are ready to fill/roll/serve them."
